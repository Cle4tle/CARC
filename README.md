csgo auto resolution changer

After the new trusted mode anticheat update in 2020, the only way somebody could screen capture their CSGO gameplay would be to either use display capture that will capture everything happening on the user's screen, which will put extra load on your device and isn't ideal for streamers who don't want to accidentally leak information not intended for the audience.

They could also disable trusted mode by starting the game with ``-allow_third_party_software``in the launch options.

Or they can run csgo in windowed borderless fullscreen mode instead of full screen mode which will not allow custom resolutions without changing your resolution in NVIDIA Control Panel or AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition everytime you run or exit the game.
